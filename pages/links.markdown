## Books and articles about mutation testing and PIT

* How to [Hunt The Bugs With Mutation Testing](https://www.sipios.com/blog-tech/hunt-the-bugs-with-mutation-testing) with Pitest in the Sipios Blog.
* Chris Rimmer put together a nice explanation of what mutation testing is all about for a lightning talk in oxford. [Getting mutants to test your tests](http://media.ogn.s3.amazonaws.com/ogn27/microslot-ChrisRimmer.pdf). Audio is also available [mp3](http://media.ogn.s3.amazonaws.com/27-microslot-ChrisRimmer.mp3). 
* Filip van Laenen's article in the ACCU magazine *Overload* provides another nice overview of mutation testing, looking mainly at Ruby, but with
 some discussion of Java and PIT towards the end. [Overload 108](http://accu.org/var/uploads/journals/overload108.pdf)
* The *Overload* 108 article is based on a presentation Filip van Laenen gave at OOP 2012 in Munich. The slides from that presentation can be viewed at SlideShare. [Mutation Testing](http://www.slideshare.net/filipvanlaenen/mutation-testing-11298526)
* [An introduction to Mutation Testing](https://pedrorijo.com/blog/intro-mutation/), by Pedro Rijo, which contains the problem that Mutation Testing tries to solve, the presentation of the basic concepts, and a quick section on Extreme Mutation. Slides for the talk based on the article available at [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/pedrorijo91/mutation-testing-pixels-camp-2019).
* PIT gets a mention in Tomek Kaczanowski's book [Practical Unit Testing with TestNG and Mockito](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/839348930X).
* German article about mutation testing with PIT [Mutationstests mit PIT in Java](https://m.heise.de/developer/artikel/Mutationstests-mit-PIT-in-Java-3888683.html)
