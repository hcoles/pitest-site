## Releases

See [https://github.com/hcoles/pitest/releases](https://github.com/hcoles/pitest/releases)

## Historic releases

These are old releases from before pitest was migrated to Github. Please see [https://github.com/hcoles/pitest/releases](https://github.com/hcoles/pitest/releases) for recent releases.

Binaries for all releases can be found on [maven central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=org.pitest).

### 0.32

* restores java 7 compatibility
* new remove conditionals mutator
* support for mutating static initializers with TestNG
* properly isolate classpaths when running via Ant
* break builds on coverage threshold
* allow JVM to be specified
* support user defined test selection strategies
* support user defined output format
* support user defined test prioritisation
* fix for issue blocking usage with [Robolectric](http://robolectric.org/)

Note, setup for Ant based projects changes in this release. See [ant setup](http://pitest.org/quickstart/ant/) for details on usage.

### 0.31

* Maven 2 compatibility restored
* Much faster line coverage calculation
* Fix for issue 78 - Error when PowerMockito test stores mock as member

This release also changes some internal implementation details, some of which may be of interest/importance to those maintaining tools that
integrate with PIT.

Mutations are now scoped internally as described in [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pitusers/E0-3QZuMYjE](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pitusers/E0-3QZuMYjE)

A new class (org.pitest.mutationtest.tooling.EntryPoint) has been introduced that removes some of the duplications that existed in the various ways of launching mutation analysis. 

### 0.30

* Support for parametrized [Spock](http://code.google.com/p/spock/) tests
* Support for [JUnitParams](http://code.google.com/p/junitparams/) tests
* Fix for issue 73 - JUnit parameterised tests calling mutee during setup failing during mutation phase
* Fix to issue 63 - ant task fails when empty options supplied
* Ability to override maven options from command line
* Ability to fail a build if it does not achieve a given mutation score
* Performance improvement when tests use @BeforeClass or @AfterClass annotations
* Slightly improved scheduling over multiple threads
* Improved maven multi project support
* Integration with source control for maven users


### 0.29

* Incremental analysis (--historyInputLocation and --historyOutputLocation)
* Inlined code detection turned on by default
* Quieter logging by default
* Improved Java 7 support
* Upgrade of ASM from 3.3 to 4
* Fix for concurrency issues during coverage collection
* Fix for issue 53 - problems with snapshot JUnit versions
* Fix for issue 59 - duplicate dependencies set via maven


### 0.28

* Inlined finally block detection (--detectInlinedCode)
* New experimental switch statement mutator (contributed by Chris Rimmer)
* Do not mutate Groovy classes
* Fix for issue 33 - set user.dir to match surefire
* Fix for issue 43 - optionally suppress timestamped folders (--timestampedReports=true/false)
* Fix for issue 44 - concurrent modification exception when gathering coverage
* Fix for issue 46 - incorrect setting of flags by ant task
* Smaller memory footprint for main process
* Faster coverage gathering for large codebases
* Faster classpath scanning for large codebases
* Support for JUnit 3 suite methods
* Fixes for incorrect detection of JUnit 3 tests

**Known issue** - Fix for issue 33 may not resolve the issue for maven 2 users.

Detection of Groovy code has not yet been tested with Groovy 2 which may generate substantially different
byte code to earlier versions.

### 0.27

* Much prettier reports
* Now avoids mutating assert statements
* Removed inScopeClasses option - use targetClasses and targetTests instead
* Fix for 100% CPU usage when child JVM crashes
* Fix for issues 35/38 - experimental member variable mutator now corrects stack
* Fix for issue 39 - order of classpath elements now maintained when running from maven

**Upgrading users may need to modify their build due to the removal of the inScopeClasses parameter**

### 0.26

* Ant support
* New experimental mutator for member variables 
* Fix for issues 12/27 - no longer hangs when code under test launches non daemon threads
* Fix for issue 26 - now warns when no test library found on classpath
* Fix for issue 30 - now errors if mutated classes have no line or source debug
* Fix for issue 32 - now correctly handles JUnit assumptions 

**Known issue** - The new member variable mutator may cause errors in synchronized errors. The mutator is
however disabled by default, and the generated errors are correctly handled by PIT.

### 0.25

* TestNG support (experimental)
* Fix for issue where mutations in nested classes are not isolated from each other
* Fix for broken classpath isolation for projects using xstream
* Improved handling of JUnit parametrized tests
* Ability to limit mutations to specific classpath roots (--mutableCodePaths)
* Ability to add non launch classpath roots (--classPath) (experimental)
* Read configuration values from XML (experimental)
* Option to not throw an error when no mutations are found
* Consistent ordering of classes in HTML report
* Statistics written to console
* Classes no longer loaded during initial classpath scanning
* New syntax to easily enable all mutation operations

### 0.24

* JMockit support
* Option to output results in XML or CSV
* Fix for [issue 11](http://code.google.com/p/pitestrunner/issues/detail?id=11)
* Improved INLINE_CONSTS mutator

### 0.23

* Fix for issue 7 - source files not located

### 0.22

* Upgrade of Xstream to 1.4.1 to enable OpenJDK 7 support
* Fix for issue 5 - corruption of newline character in child processes
* Ability to set child process launch arguments

### 0.21

* Significant performance improvements
* Support for PowerMock via both classloader (requires PowerMockIgnore annotation) and java agent
* Minor error reporting and usability improvements
* Fix for major defect around dependency analysis
* PIT dependencies no longer placed on classpath when running via maven
* Support for excluding certain classes or tests
* Support for verbose logging

### 0.20

* Support for excluding tests greater than a certain distance from class
* Support for excluding methods from mutation analysis
* Performance improvements
* Removed support for launching mutation reports from JUnit runner

### 0.18

* First public release
