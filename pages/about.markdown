# About PIT

PIT is largely the work of myself - Henry Coles, a software developer based in Edinburgh, but has benefited from contributions from numerous others.

If you'd like to get in touch I can be contacted at **henry@pitest.org**. Please do not use this address for support requests - these should be sent
to the google group where they'll get a better/faster response.
