# Quickstart

Out of the box PIT can be launched from the command line, ant or maven. Third party
components provide integration with Gradle, Eclipse, IntelliJ and others (see the [links](/links "links") section for details).

The impatient can jump straight to the section for their chosen build tool - it may however be helpful to read the basic concepts section first.
